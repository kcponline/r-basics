		<h2>a commit is erased from remote branch - reverted back to prior commit</h2>
		<p>deleting a remote branch is known as rewriting history which is not a good practice and can cause a lot of other unintended problems when there are other collaboraors who had cloned, fetched, pulled and made changes.  However, for a beginner, it's ok to do as a solo.</p>

		<p>Note, in vim editor, move the blinking cursor to the line which is to be deleted and then enter "d" twice to clear the line which means the commit as stated by that line will be deleted. Then to finish, enter ":wq" and press enter.  ":wq" means to save and exit and is required. However if a mistake is made and you wish to redo the vim editor, then use ":q!" to exit w/o saving.</p>
